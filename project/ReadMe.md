    1. Create a JSON file under agents folder in order to define the name, tag the agent will respond to, and the name of the agent, plus the system prompt
    2. add the agents tag to agent_class_mapping dict, currently found in main.py
    3. define the logic for the agents handle function and inherit from the agent base class inside of llm_Agent_utils.py
